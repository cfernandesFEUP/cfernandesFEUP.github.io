Welcome to my webpage!

Here, youâ€™ll find an overview of my publications, insights into my ongoing research, and a glimpse into some of my hobbies.

I hold a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, and my research focuses on tribology applied to machine elements. My work combines experimental and modelling approaches to understand mechanical components' friction, wear, and efficiency. I also explore polymer gears, surface engineering, and lubricant formulation, bridging fundamental studies with real-world applications.

Beyond research, I teach Machine Elements and Surface Engineering at FEUP, University of Porto. I also lead the Tribology, Vibrations, and Industrial Maintenance research unit (CETRIB) at INEGI, collaborating with industry and academia to develop durable and efficient mechanical systems.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing jazz guitar.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or discussion!
